# swapi-starwars
This directory contains my solution for fetching, displaying and sorting all starship data from The Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/)

## Project Files
The main files are index.html, style.css, starwars.svg and script.js
- index.html contains w3c validated HTML required on page load, this HTML will always be needed on the page.
- style.css contains the required styling to make the page more aesthetically pleasing within a responsive grid system.
- starwars.svg is an image used by style.css for styling purposes
- script.js contains the JavaScript for variables, objects, event listeners and functions in order to manipulate the DOM to display and sort the starship data (comments can be found within the JS file)
